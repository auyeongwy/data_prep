A file stores time durations in the following format where every line is a duplicated again:

0:01:56
0:01:56
0:21:46
0:21:46
0:21:53
0:21:53
0:11:48
0:11:48
0:21:47
0:21:47
0:07:55
0:07:55

This application parses the file, removes duplicates, change time to a numerical value, e.g. 0:01:50 = 1.833. Then collects the results into a separate target file where the results are tallied up as follows:

Less than 3 minutes: 
3-6 minutes:
6-9 minutes:

More than 21 minutes:

To see how this application works, an example data file 0715.csv is included. To run, just execute "python data_prep.py 0715.csv".
